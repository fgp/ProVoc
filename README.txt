Thank you for downloading the source code of ProVoc! Please take a moment
to read the following lines:

- This source code is available under the BSD license (see below)
- This code base is really, really old... Please keep in mind that this
    software has grown from a simple vocabulary training app that we've
    written (probably like many of you out there) "just for our own needs".
- Be thus accordingly indulgent! We known that the overall structure,
    the design patterns used, well... almost everything could have been
    much clearer and much better -- if only we had the same knowledge
    at that time as today.
- If you want to rewrite this app, think seriously about adopting some
    up-to-date technology (CoreData is beyond any question, so as
    QTCapture and all sorts of other things)
- This code should primarly serve as a reference for those of you
    who want to write some "importers" for ProVoc vocabulary files.
- Please understand that we don't have time anymore to provide support
    of any kind, or answer questions about the code.

Having said that, enjoy developing for Mac OS X -- we can assure you that
it's really a fun and inspiring experience!
