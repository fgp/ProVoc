				<h1>Reviewing your vocabulary</h1>
			</div>
			<p>ProVoc also offers a way to maintain your vocabulary in the long term, by letting you only train the words that need to be reviewed. This method is also known as interval repetition or memorization.</p>
			<p>Each word is reviewed regularly, the time interval between the last successful training and the next review increasing with the difficulty of the word.</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ul>
					<li>Check the training option <span class="command">Words needed to be reviewed</span> to review words in selected lessons. The number of words needed to be reviewed is indicated at the top of the window.
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>To see the date of the next review of each word:</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ul>
					<li>In the <span class="command">Editing</span> section, select <span class="command">Edit &gt; View Options</span> and check <span class="command">Next Review</span><li>The columns indicates the earliest date on which the words need to be reviewed</ul>
			</div>
			<p>To modify the frequency at which words are reviewed:</p>
			<div id="taskbox">
				<ul>
					<li>Select <span class="command">ProVoc &gt; Preferences &gt; Training</span>
					<li>You can adjust the following parameters:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="command">Learning speed</span>: indicates how many times a word needs to be initially reviewed more often before being &quot;learned&quot; and only reviewed more sporadically.
							<li><span class="command">Training</span>: indicates how often words should be reviewed.
						</ul>
					
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>For instance, you may decrease the learning speed to review more often more difficult words; or you may increase the training to review less words at a time.</p>
